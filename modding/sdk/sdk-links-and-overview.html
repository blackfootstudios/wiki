The GROUND BRANCH Mod Kit or SDK ("`Software Development Kit`") is used to create more advanced mods combining native Unreal Engine 4 elements such as textures, materials, static meshes, skeletal meshes, sounds, and so on.

Asset based mods are created, packaged and uploaded within the Mod Kit / SDK, which is downloadable as a separate program from the Epic launcher / store (@needs link when live). The SDK includes the base systems from GROUND BRANCH but none of the maps and assets.
Placeholder meshes are provided, for example for weapons, to allow you to access standard animations and sounds and suchlike.
