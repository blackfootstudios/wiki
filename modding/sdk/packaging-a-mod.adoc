== The packaging process

Once you’ve created a mod and want to package it up ready for uploading to the workshop, you’ll need to click the button "`Package Mod`" and then select the mod you’d like to Package

This will start the packaging process which is exactly the same as the regular one (with a popup and sound)

Assuming all went well you should see `+%MOD_NAME%.pak+` in `+%PROJECT_ROOT%\GroundBranch\Saved\StagedMods\%MOD_NAME%\+` now you’ve packaged your mod it’s time to link:/modding/sdk/uploading-a-mod[upload] to Steam Workshop!

If the packaging step fails, you should find an explanation for the failure in the output log. You may have blueprint compile errors (see generic Unreal Engine 4 documentation for solutions), or other errors that are hopefully self-explanatory.

When you start packaging, you should be offered a chance to open a log window to see how cooking and packaging is progressing (see picture above). If not, you can open it manually via Windows / Developer / Output Log.

## Trouble-shooting packaging errors

There's a lot that can go wrong when packaging a mod, but most errors in the log should at least point to the asset(s) causing problems. Here are some issues that may come up while packaging mods, and some possible solutions:

**I get a lot of errors when I use the menu option to package/cook the project**

-> Don't use any editor menus to cook the project! Use the Package button only

NOTE: The Mod Kit Package button will only cook and package the relevant plug-in folder for the selected mod. The editor 'Package Project' and 'Cook Content For Windows' options will try to cook/package all of the Mod Kit content, including the GBCore section. This is A Bad Thing and it will likely not work.

** I get packaging errors in the log that I can't figure out**

-> Is your mod folder set read-only? Set it to be not read only in Windows folder view
