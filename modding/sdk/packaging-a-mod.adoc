== The packaging process

Once you’ve created a mod and want to package it up ready for uploading to the workshop, you’ll need to click the button "`Package Mod`" and then select the mod you’d like to Package

This will start the packaging process which is exactly the same as the regular one (with a popup and sound)

Assuming all went well you should see `+%MOD_NAME%.pak+` in `+%PROJECT_ROOT%\GroundBranch\Saved\StagedMods\%MOD_NAME%\+` now you’ve packaged your mod it’s time to link:/modding/sdk/uploading-a-mod[upload] to Steam Workshop!

If it fails check the output log, common reasons it might fail:

* Your mod has compile errors
* Your mod is marked read-only

When you start packaging, you should be offered a chance to open a log window to see how cooking and packaging is progressing (see picture above). If not, you can open it manually via Windows / Developer / Output Log.

## Trouble-shooting packaging errors

There's a lot that can go wrong when packaging a mod, but most errors in the log are hopefully self-explanatory, or will at least point to the item causing problems. Here are some issues that have come up while packaging mods, and some possible solutions:

**I get a lot of errors when I use the menu option to cook the project**

-> Don't use any editor menus to cook the project! Use the Package button only

NOTE: The Mod Kit Package button will only attempt to cook and package your mods. This also keeps the process relatively quick. The 'Package Project' and 'Cook Content For Windows' options and similar will try to cook and package everything in the Mod Kit, including the GBCore section. This will likely fail and will in any event take a very long time to complete.
