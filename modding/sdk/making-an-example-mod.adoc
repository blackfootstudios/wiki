== Creating the blueprint

Create a new blueprint with `+BP_Handgun_Master+`.

== Skeletal Mesh/Physics Asset

A mesh needs to be "`skinned`" to a skeleton and imported as a SkeletalMesh.

Handguns all use the same skeleton.
Bones are not allowed to be rotated, but can be translated (moved) to new locations.
The existing animations will still work properly.
