NOTE: to do

The switch parameters refer to various things you can have in your Combo texture. Since they are greyscale, we pack the Ambient Occlusion, Roughness and Metallic maps into one texture. 

There are generally 2 ways people pack them based on the color channel:
RMA
Red - Roughness
Green - Metallic
Blue - AO

ORM (Standard for UE4)
Red - AO
Green - Roughness
Blue - Metallic

If you don't have a combo texture, or just want to approximate things, you can leave a channel unchecked and use the scalars above. 

DiffuseRedAsSpecMap will use the red channdel of the BaseColor map to approximate specularity. Otherwise it uses the scalar above.
