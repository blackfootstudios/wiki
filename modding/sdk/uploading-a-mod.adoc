=  Uploading a mod

Upload your mod to Steam Workshop.

First we need to prepare the workshop item data, if you don’t have one that because it hasn’t created a Steam Workshop Item yet, but pressing Upload Mod will generate one, then stick all your content in the workshop folder and repackage.

Open your WorkshopItem in the root of your mod’s content folder and fill out the details

Uploading your mod to Steam workshop will be hidden by default (for new mods) so you can still test it and don’t have to worry about it being public.

Assuming you’re logged into Steam with an account that owns Ground Branch and have steam running.
You’ll get information of what stage and sometimes a percent of the progress of your mod upload.
