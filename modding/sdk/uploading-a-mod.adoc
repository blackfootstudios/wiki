## Carrying out the mod upload

First we need to prepare the workshop item data, if you don’t have one that because it hasn’t created a Steam Workshop Item yet, but pressing Upload Mod will generate one, then stick all your content in the workshop folder and repackage.

Open your WorkshopItem in the root of your mod’s content folder and fill out the details

Uploading your mod to Steam workshop will be hidden by default (for new mods) so you can still test it and don’t have to worry about it being public.

Assuming you’re logged into Steam with an account that owns Ground Branch and have steam running.
You’ll get information of what stage and sometimes a percent of the progress of your mod upload.

Your mod is now uploaded, you can now subscribe and once downloaded should be able to see it in game!

## Trouble-shooting mod uploads

There's a few things that can go wrong when uploading a mod, though we can't predict them all. Here are some issues that have come up while uploading mods, and some possible solutions:


**I set my thumbnail path to `(...)/MyMod/Content/Resources/Thumbnail_MyMod.uasset` but the thumbnail is broken**

-> You need to provide a link to a normal image file, not an asset (a .uasset Unreal Engine file that is created when importing an image into the Mod Kit). e.g. `(...)/Thumbnail_MyMod.jpg`. Ordinary image files are not visible within the Mod Kit. Use the default operating system file explorer to set up the thumbnail image file.
