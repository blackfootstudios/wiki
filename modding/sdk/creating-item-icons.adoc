The convention is that your weapon icon is called ICON_<ItemBPName> and loaded into the same directory as your item blueprint.

The icons should be 512x256 resolution, and Compression Settings should be set to UserInterface2D. Texture Group (in Level Of Detail section) should be set to UI.

### How to make the icons

No program or method is officially endorsed by BlackFoot Studios, but here are some icon creation methods suggested by modders:

. *Substance Stager and Photoshop*

First set the model up in stager, then change the background color to R:0 G:255 B:0, so it's easy to go into Photoshop and magic erase the green screen for the transparent png image.

Then apply a B&W filter over the picture and add the Brightness/Contrast filter and just change the brightness to 100 or thereabouts, so it looks similar to the other weapon icons.
