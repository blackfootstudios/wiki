To start making a weapon mod, follow the usual steps to link:/modding/sdk/creating-a-mod[create a mod], find an appropriate master blueprint (`+BP_Handgun_Master+` for sidearms, or see link:/modding/sdk/master-bps-weapons[this list] for primary weapon master blueprints). Then link:/modding/sdk/creating-child-assets[create an appropriate child blueprint]. This guide assumes that you have followed these steps and have your new custom BP open like so:

A weapon mod can be a complex item to set up. Here, for example, are some (not all) files needed for the in-game stock M16A4 rifle. See below for more details of what these files typically include:

.Editor files for M16A4 in-game item (not including master blueprint, wwise sounds, and so on)

Please see link:/modding/sdk/weapon/weapon-blueprint-properties[here] for a run-down of (nearly) all of the properties in your new custom firearm blueprint.

First of all, you will most likely start by putting in a new firearm model (skeletal mesh) and skin (material) into the `+Firearm Mesh Component+` properties.

You will need to make sure that your skeletal mesh model is skinned properly before importing into the Mod Kit (see link:/modding/sdk/weapon/skinning-weapon-models[skinning weapon models] for more details).

You will need to make sure you have properly link:/modding/sdk/weapon/setting-up-weapon-skeletal-mesh[set up your skeletal mesh], so that all the animation aspects will work properly. 

You may need to add additional components to your weapon in the blueprint editor. Here, the in-game M16A4 blueprint is shown, including additional GBSight components for the built-in iron sights (FailSafeSight, FrontSightPost), and a number of GBRail components to define attachment points for  the picatinny rails (RearSightRail, TopRail, BottomRail, RightRail, LeftRail), as shown here:

Typically each component has further configuration options that can be used to customise your weapon further, such as the GBRail components, for example:

See link:/modding/sdk/weapon/ground-branch-weapon-components[here] for a list of all of the Ground Branch custom weapon blueprint components.

With all the weapon features now defined in your blueprint, you may need to add custom code to your weapon blueprint to handle custom behaviour for your specific weapon. See link:/modding/sdk/weapon/example-blueprint-code[weapon blueprint code examples] for more information on weapon events and functions that you can and may want to override in the blueprint event graph.

You should also create a link:/modding/sdk/weapon/creating-default-item-loadout[default item build] for your weapon, at least to add a magazine as a default item.

Congratulations! At this point, your weapon should be set up. Go package and upload it, and have a test.
