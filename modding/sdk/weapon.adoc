How to create weapon mods.

To start a weapon mod, follow the usual steps to link:/modding/sdk/creating-a-mod[create a mod], find an appropriate master blueprint (`+BP_Handgun_Master+` for sidearms, or see link:/modding/sdk/master-bps-weapons[this list] for primary weapon master blueprints). Then link:/modding/sdk/creating-child-assets[create an appropriate child blueprint]. This guide assumes that you have followed these steps and have your new custom BP open like so:

A weapon mod can be a complex item to set up. Here, for example, are some (not all) files needed for the in-game stock M16A4 rifle. See below for more details of what these files typically include:

Please see link:/modding/sdk/weapon/weapon-blueprint-properties[here] for a run-down of (nearly) all of the properties in your new custom firearm blueprint.

First of all, you will most likely start by putting in a new firearm model (skeletal mesh) and skin (material) into the `+Firearm Mesh Component+` properties.

You will need to make sure that your skeletal mesh model is skinned properly before importing into the Mod Kit (see link:/modding/sdk/weapon/skinning-weapon-models[skinning weapon models] for more details).

You will then need to
