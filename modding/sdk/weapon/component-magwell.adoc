* `Default Magazine Class` This is the preferred magazine type. Other magazines having the same Magazine Type can be fitted in the weapon editor, if available.
* `Start Plus One` When initially chambering a round, don't remove a round from the magazine.
* `Stay Open on Last Round` When the magazine is empty, keep the bolt open.
* `Is Firing from Open Bolt` If true, a round does not need to be chambered to fire (e.g for Uzi, MAC-10, M249). This can be changed mid-game for hybrid/adaptive firearms.
