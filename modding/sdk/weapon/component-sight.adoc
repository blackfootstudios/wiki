## Overview

Sight components are an integral part of any sight, whether internal or attachable. Attachable sights are of class GBDirectSight, but will include a GBSightComponent blueprint component.

You may want or need to have internal sights, and these also use the GBSightComponent blueprint component. A lot of the standard sight properties will be irrelevant (for example relating to magnification).

## Properties of GBSightComponent
The most useful/pertinent properties of the sight blueprint component are listed below:
