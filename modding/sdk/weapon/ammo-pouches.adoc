## Ammo pouch types

Ammo pouches are automatically added to your loadout based on the projectile type used in the magazine of your primary weapon and sidearm. (They can be added manually also.)

To enable this to happen, you need to use one of the following pouch names in any custom magazines that you make, in the `Default Pouch Type` field. See link:/modding/sdk/weapon/magazine-modding[modding magazines].
