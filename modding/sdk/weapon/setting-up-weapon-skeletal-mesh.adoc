It is assumed that you have already link:/modding/sdk/weapon/skinning-weapon-models[skinned the weapon mesh properly] and imported it as an Unreal Engine skeletal mesh. 
The normal convention is to use the prefix `+SK_xxx+` for skeletal meshes.

You will be familiar with the Unreal Engine 4 feature that when you open a skeletal mesh or its associated animation blueprint (`+ABP_xxx+`) or physics definition (`+PHYS_xxx+`), a special viewer will open with a set of buttons allowing easy switching between skeleton, skeletal mesh, animation, animation blueprint and physics:

=== Skeleton view
.weapon_mk16_skel.jpg
image::/images/sdk/weapon/weapon_mk16_skel.jpg[weapon_mk16_skel.jpg]

This view allows you to visualise the weapon bones (discussed in the skinning link above). You will be (re)using an existing skeleton from GBCore, so the ability to add skeletal sockets will not be needed. You can probably ignore this view.

=== Skeletal mesh view (SK_xxx)
.weapon_m16_skmesh.jpg
image::/images/sdk/weapon/weapon_m16_skmesh.jpg[weapon_m16_skmesh.jpg]

This view allows you to preview the mesh that you have imported and to add mesh sockets (as opposed to skeletal sockets) to define custom attachment points or similar for your weapon.

There are some sockets that you need to add:

- `SelfieCam` The viewpoint for the 'selfie cam' spectator view. The selfie camera points from this socket towards the operator eyes. Every weapon mesh should have one of these.
- `<SuppressorSocketName>` A socket name to define where a suppressor attaches, if applicable (not all weapons take suppressors). This socket name needs to be filled in also in the Muzzle Device Thread field in the GBBarrel component of a weapon. The same socket name is used to determine which suppressors (if any) are compatible with a particular barrel (and thus weapon).
- `CollisionTraceEnd` For the purpose of collision checking, it is assumed that the end of the barrel component is at the end of the mesh. If not, such as on the M16, you will need to manually create a CollisionTraceEnd socket to define the very end of the weapon/barrel.

Other socket names may exist to denote a particular function for a particular part of the skeletal mesh.

=== Animation view (ABP_xxx)
.weapon_mk16_animation.jpg
image::/images/sdk/weapon/weapon_mk16_animation.jpg[weapon_mk16_animation.jpg]

This view lets you preview assigned animations/montages for particular operations on/with your weapon, if you put your new weapon mesh into the Preview Mesh field at the top right. Your weapon should animate in this screen in the same was as it will in-game in response to the selected operations/animations.

=== Animation blueprint view (ABP_xxx)
.weapon_m16_blueprint.jpg
image::/images/sdk/weapon/weapon_m16_blueprint.jpg[weapon_m16_blueprint.jpg]

This view lets you alter the internals of the animation blueprint, to provide custom poses and other custom animation features. The animation blueprint is a separate entity to the weapon blueprint, and it is really for advanced use only. If you don't know what you are doing, leave this well alone, is our suggestion.

=== Physics view (PHYS_xxx)
.weapon_mk16_physics.jpg
image::/images/sdk/weapon/weapon_mk16_physics.jpg[weapon_mk16_physics.jpg]

This view allows you to define a simplified physics representation of the weapon, principally used for (but not limited to) defining collision for the weapon. Physics collisions are comprised of simple (as simple as possible, in fact) primitive shapes such as capsules, boxes and spheres.

NOTE: All sight rails (that is, rails to which sights can be attached) must be 'poking out' of the physics collision elements. If they are within the physics elements, it will not be possible to attach any sights. See the top rail in the picture above.

TIP: Make sure your component rails are attached in the correct orientation (origin/pivot point at rear of weapon) or you may have a problem that looks like incorrect physics element placement, but isn't.
