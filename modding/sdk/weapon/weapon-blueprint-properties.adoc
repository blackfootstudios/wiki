//= Weapon blueprint properties
[abstract]
The meaning of properties and components in blueprints derived from `BP_Firearm_Master`.

A rundown is given below of the meaning and usage of the properties that you will see in blueprints derived from `+BP_Firearm_Master+`. Just as you will have derived your custom firearm from a specific firearm master blueprint, all firearm master blueprints are child classes of `+BP_Firearm_Master+`. Individual firearm master blueprints will generally have different properties, different meshes, and different components possibly, but a vast majority of the properties of individual firearm master blueprints will be shared.

For the most part, you will not want to change *any* of these values.
Only the most relevant sections are shown below, and only the most relevant properties within those sections are described.
Properties whose purpose and content are deemed relatively self-explanatory are also omitted below.
In some cases, properties are working variables, which is to say that they are set and used at runtime.
For example, `+Dry Fire Trigger Pulls+` is a count of how many times a player has pulled the trigger while the ammo is out.
