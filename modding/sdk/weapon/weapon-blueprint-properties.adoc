//= Weapon blueprint properties
[abstract]
The meaning of properties and components in blueprints derived from `BP_Firearm_Master`.

A rundown is given below of the meaning and usage of the properties that you will see in blueprints derived from `+BP_Firearm_Master+`. Just as you will have derived your custom firearm from a specific firearm master blueprint, all firearm master blueprints are child classes of `+BP_Firearm_Master+`. Individual firearm master blueprints will generally have different properties, different meshes, and different components possibly, but a vast majority of the properties of individual firearm master blueprints will be shared.

[TIP]
--
If in doubt, just stick to the default values for properties.
--
[NOTE]
--
Only the most relevant sections are shown below, and only the most relevant properties within those sections are described.
Properties whose purpose and content are deemed relatively self-explanatory are also omitted below.
In some cases, properties are working variables, which is to say that they are set and used at runtime.
For example, `+Dry Fire Trigger Pulls+` is a count of how many times a player has pulled the trigger while the ammo is out.

=== Blueprint default properties

.Firearm properties
image::/images/sdk/weapon/weapon_properties_firearm.jpg[weapon_properties_firearm.jpg,60%]

* `+Camera Shake Class+` this specifies a type of camera shake that will be played whenever the weapon is fired.
* `+No More Ammo Text+` this text is displayed when the weapon is out of ammo and the player tries to fire it.
* `+Max Dry Fire Trigger Pulls+` this is how many times to play the '`dry fire`' animation if the player attempts to shoot the weapon without any ammo in it.
* `+Alpha Different Threshold+` @
* `+Firing Modes+` each firing mode has a separate entry in this table, defining the number of shots fired (so long as the trigger is held down) and the rate of fire (measured in seconds between shots). @where is the text determined e.g.Â semi / auto?
* `+Barrel Aim Angle Threshold+` @
* `+Min Sight Relative X+` @
* `+Max Grip Relative X+` @

.Inventory properties

These properties are common to every '`GB Item`' in game, and define inventory properties of the item (in this case weapon).

* `Item Asset Type` This should be PrimaryFirearm or Sidearm, depending on what you are making.
* `Item Weight` This is the weight of the rifle (without any attachments) in kilograms. The M16A4 stock rifle has a weight of 3.257, for example.
* `Display Name` This is the name that should be used for the weapon in-game.
* `Icon` This should be set to a UI texture (Texture2D type) with an icon of the weapon.
* Left and Right Equip/Equipped tags:

(kris or John to explain? Specifically the AR15 codes and why two sets of tags are needed, etc)

.ABP Animation properties

* `Dust Cover Open` @
* `Front Sight Post Offset` @
* `Rear Sight Vec` @
* `Rear Sight Rot` @
* `Safety Alpha` @

.AI Config properties
image::/images/sdk/weapon/weapon_properties_aiconfig.jpg[Screenshot,60%]

* `Weight No Cover Advance` Determines relatively how likely it is that an AI using this weapon will advance towards the enemy when taking fire. This may be weighted relatively highly for assault style weapons, for example. 
* `Weight No Cover Go Prone` Determines relatively how likely it is that an AI using this weapon will drop to prone when taking fire. This may be weighted relatively highly for light machine guns, for example.
* `Weight No Cover Go Crouch` Determines relatively how likely it is that an AI using this weapon will crouch down when taking fire.

.Animation properties
image::/images/sdk/weapon/weapon_properties_animation.jpg[Screenshot,60%]

* `Recoil Montage` This is the animation montage to display when a shot is fired.
* `Prone Recoil Montage` This is the animation montage to display when a shot is fired from prone.
[TIP]
--
For a choice of in-built recoil animation montages for different weapons and calibres, search for `AM_XXX_Recoil_YYY` montages in `GBCore/Character/Animations/\...`
--
For all the other settings, it is highly recommended to just use the default values in the relevant weapon master blueprint. Here are the animation actions for the M16A4 rifle, for example:

.Effects properties
image::/images/sdk/weapon/weapon_properties_effects.jpg[Screenshot,60%]

* `Flash FXNiagara` This is the Niagara effect to use when a muzzle flash occurs
* `Smoke FXNiagara` This is the Niagara effect to use for muzzle smoke (after each shot)
* `Shell FXNiagara` This is the Niagara effect to use for spawning used shells (after each shot)

.Recoil properties
image::/images/sdk/weapon/weapon_properties_recoil.jpg[Screenshot,60%]

* `Recoil Impulse Time`
* `Recoil Recovery Time`

* `Recoil per shot` These properties define the extent of the deflection (up and down) caused by each shot, in degrees, and in engaged position (Engaged Recoil Per Shot) and otherwise (Recoil Per Shot). A random value for the pitch and yaw is chosen within the specified ranges on each shot.

.Sound properties
image::/images/sdk/weapon/weapon_properties_sound.jpg[Screenshot,60%]

* `Firearm Sound Type` This is the name of the sound bank that should be used for firearm sounds. You will most likely want to use one of the built-in weapon sound banks. If you are feeling brave, you can check out link:/modding/sdk/wwise[modding with Wwise].

.Stamina properties
image::/images/sdk/weapon/weapon_properties_stamina.jpg[Screenshot,60%]

These properties are relatively finely tuned and should not be altered if possible. These are unitless constants that have fairly self-evident effects. High recovery values mean a quick recovery, and high exhaustion values mean a quicker stamina exhaustion when holding the weapon in engaged or ready posture.

.UI properties
image::/images/sdk/weapon/weapon_properties_ui.jpg[Screenshot,60%]

* `Customisation Widget` This is a @explanation of and link to customisation widget creation
* `Drag Drop Operations` @
