# Weapon modding

To start a weapon mod, follow the usual steps to [create a mod](/modding/sdk/creating-a-mod), find an appropriate master blueprint (`BP_Handgun_Master` for sidearms, or see [this list](/modding/sdk/master-bps-weapons) for primary weapon master blueprints). Then [create an appropriate child blueprint](/modding/sdk/creating-child-assets). This guide assumes that you have followed these steps and have your new custom BP open like so:
