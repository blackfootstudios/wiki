To make a custom magazine, make a child blueprint of the master blueprint as usual (`BP_Magazine_Master`). It will look something like this when you open it:

The key thing is to have a MagazineType property that exactly matches the magazine type of the MagWell component of your weapon (GBExternalMagazine class). In this example, the magazine type name is STANAG556:

Properties of the magazine base class that you are most likely to need to deal with include:

* `Capacity` This is how many bullets the magazine holds when full
* `Initial Count` How many bullets the magazine starts out with (-1 -> full magazine)
* `Bullet Item Class` The class of the bullet loaded in the magazine (for the purpose of displaying in the magazine) @tbc
* `Base Bullet Item Class` The class of the bullet loaded in the magazine (for the purpose of spawning a bullet) @tbc
* `Tracer Item Class` The bullet class to use if/when a tracer is fired
* `Start Tracer Count`
* `Tracer Frequency`
