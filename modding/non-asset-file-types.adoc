The following is a list of file types recognised by the Quick Create mod system.
These are '`non asset`' file types used in Ground Branch.
By '`non asset`' it is meant that the files are not created or visible within the Ground Branch Mod Kit.
With the exception of Mission files, these '`non asset`' files are normally edited or created using third party programs (text editors, image editors, and so on):
