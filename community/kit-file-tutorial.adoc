The following describes how to customize the main menu guys.
The same steps can also be used to create AI kits.

== Overview

[arabic]
. Go to `+steamapps\common\Ground Branch\GroundBranch\Content\GroundBranch\DefaultLoadouts+`
. Make a backup of `+MainMenuGuy_01.kit+` and `+MainMenuGuy_02.kit+`
. Create a kit in the "`Customize Operator`" screen.
. Open NoTeam.kit in text editor and copy paste the relevant entries to `+MainMenuGuy_01.kit+` and `+MainMenuGuy_02.kit+`. The .kit files are JSON files.
Use an editor that has JSON support for more comfort (e.g: VS Code or Intellij IDEA). The general syntax of JSON is described on Wikipedia.
. `+ItemBuild+` references in the JSON need to removed.
. In the main menu use console command `+restartlevel+` to apply your changes without restarting the game.
The console can be opened with the NumPad `+*+` key.
